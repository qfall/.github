## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of students developing a prototyping library for Lattice Cryptography.
The project runs under the name `qFALL - quantum resistant fast lattice library`
in the winter term 2022 and summer term 2023 by the Codes and Cryptography research group in Paderborn.

Our plan is to develop a library which itself primarily focuses on prototyping for researchers and
teaching for lecturers.

### Disclaimer
The objective of our project is not to provide best optimizations and a cryptographically secure environment.
Rather we plan to create a library that can easily be used to develop, test and benchmark new schemes.
This project will also include tutorials and sample tasks, s.t. the project can be used in lectures as well.
